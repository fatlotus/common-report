Common Report: Next-Generation UIs with Microsoft's Kinect
===

First, _what is it_? Well, this as-of-yet-unnamed project is basically an application of the fantastic [SimpleOpenNI][simple-openni] project to Microsoft's [Kinect][kinect-site]. It enables the user to make hand gestures in the view of the camera and interact with the software in a more user-friendly manner (see the [video][kinect-demo-video] for details).

Note that thanks go to the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and particularly Baker Franke for hardware support and logistics and, specifically from the latter, a fantastic six years of mentorship. Credit goes also to Sam Reynolds and the nerds of UH 202 for their suggestions and support.

Video!
----------

Here's a [video][kinect-demo-video] demonstrating the basic sorts of things I've implemented. Due to technical glitches at the time of its filming, the video is twice as fast as usual. Nonetheless, there's several highlights to the movie: OpenNI calibration; full-screen widgets; the infrared view; moving widgets; text entry; and special command modules.
